📌 Technologies Required
These are the core technologies we’ll use to ensure rapid development:

Backend:
Node.js + Express → API & server-side logic
PostgreSQL + Sequelize → Database management
Passport.js → User authentication
Dotenv → Environment variables
Render → Deployment

Frontend:
EJS → Server-side templating for dynamic pages
TailwindCSS → Fast and efficient styling (avoiding complex UI frameworks)
Alpine.js (Optional) → Lightweight interactivity if needed

Additional Tools:
GitHub → Version control & collaboration
Postman → API testing
VS Code → Development environment

🚀 User Stories for This Month (June)

We’ll speed things up with a structured weekly plan while focusing on core functionalities.

📅 Week 1: User Authentication & Role Setup
📝 User Story: "As a user, I want to register and log in securely so that I can access my dashboard."

✅ Tasks for this week:

Set up authentication using Passport.js
Implement session management (keeping users logged in)
Create login & registration UI using EJS + Tailwind
Ensure hashed passwords with bcrypt.js
Set up role-based access control (RBAC) → Admin & Users
Implement logout functionality

💡 Outcome: Fully working authentication & access control.

📅 Week 2: Ticket Management (CRUD Operations)
📝 User Story: "As a user, I want to create, view, update, and delete tickets so that I can report and track issues."

✅ Tasks for this week:
Set up Ticket model in Sequelize
Implement CRUD operations for tickets (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Build Ticket UI using EJS & Tailwind
Enable users to submit tickets with forms
Display ticket list on dashboard
Restrict ticket editing/deleting to the owner

💡 Outcome: Users can manage tickets dynamically.
📅 Week 3: Admin Panel & Ticket Management
📝 User Story: "As an admin, I need a dashboard to manage all tickets and users efficiently."
✅ Tasks for this week:
Build Admin panel UI (EJS + Tailwind)
Display all tickets & user information
Implement ticket approval, assignment & prioritization
Add search & filter functionality for tickets
Set up FAQs module for common queries
Enable category-based ticket sorting

💡 Outcome: Admins can manage tickets, approve/reject issues, and oversee user activity.

📅 Week 4: UI Enhancements & Deployment Prep
📝 User Story: "As a user, I need a visually appealing and responsive interface so that I can navigate the helpdesk easily."

✅ Tasks for this week:

Improve UI using TailwindCSS
Add better dashboard experience (alerts, animations)
Enhance ticket submission experience (success messages, validations)
Optimize mobile responsiveness
Set up Render deployment pipeline
Test all modules & prepare README.md for GitHub

💡 Outcome: A polished, deployed version ready for further expansion.

🚀 Big Picture & Future Scope
Once the core system is complete, we’ll be ready to explore future enhancements like AI-powered ticket classification, chatbots, or advanced analytics.

For now, this structured story-based roadmap ensures fast and efficient development
